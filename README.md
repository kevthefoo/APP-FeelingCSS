# FeelingCSS

## Purpose
This CSS project is designed for beginners. Rather than relying on text to explain properties and how they work, as traditional tutorials often do, I try to visualize the changes in shape, color, and size. This approach provides an intuitive understanding of CSS properties. While the project won't cover every CSS property since some properties are still best explained through text. I'll strive to make it as comprehensive as possible.
